# ✈️ Global Air Crash Analysis (1908–2024)

This project explores the history and patterns of global aviation accidents from 1908 to 2024, providing insights into how air crash trends have evolved over more than a century of flight.

Aviation has grown from early experimental aircraft to modern commercial travel, and this dataset highlights major shifts in safety, technology, and accident causes over time.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to examine:

The frequency of air crashes across different decades

Major contributing factors and causes

Geographic distribution of accidents worldwide

Trends in aviation safety improvements over time

Notable peaks during wartime and early aviation years

## 📊 Key Insights

Some of the main observations include:

Higher crash rates in the early 20th century due to limited technology

Significant increases during major war periods

A gradual decline in commercial aviation accidents with improved safety standards

Modern crashes are rarer but often involve complex operational factors

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

This project was developed using:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)


## 📈 Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:

Predictive modeling of crash risk factors

Interactive dashboards for deeper exploration

More detailed classification of accident causes
